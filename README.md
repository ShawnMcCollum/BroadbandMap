# BroadbandMap

An interactive map and analysis tool for FCC broadband availability data,
built with TypeScript, Python, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS.

> **Status:** Early development. The first milestone is an end-to-end view of
> broadband Served/Unserved status for Ohio. See
> [docs/decisions](docs/decisions/) for the design decisions behind the project.

## Data source

All data comes from the FCC National Broadband Map, **December 2025** release:

<https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download/nationwide-data?version=dec2025&pubDataVer=dec2025>

Data files are not included in this repository. Download instructions will be
provided in [`data/`](data/) as the loading pipeline is built.

## Design decisions

Architectural and scope decisions are recorded in
[docs/decisions](docs/decisions/):

## Development approach

This project is developed with AI assistance. The workflow follows a few rules:

- **One issue per session.** Each working session is focused on a single
  issue and ends in a single pull request. Keeping each session narrow keeps
  the working context to a minimum and makes every change easy to review.
- **One branch per issue.** All issue work is done on a branch, preferably
  one branch per issue, named after the issue (e.g., `docs/6-branch-pr-workflow`).
- **Pull requests only.** All merges to `main` go through a pull request.
  Nothing is committed directly to `main`.

Together these leave a clear trail from issue to branch to decision to code.
